            <h2>Baking</h2>
            <p>When Mishelle is not wrangling two children, she likes to put some time into baking. Always finding and trying new recipes coming up with some of the tastiest creations. One of my favorite things that Mishelle bakes is her Chocolate fudge. I have to say this, its better then store bought.</p>

            <h2>Soap/Candle Making</h2>
            <p>On the side of everything else going on in Mishelle's world, she has opened her own online store selling different varieties of candles and soaps. This all began as a hunt for knowledge after watching many different creators through Youtube and TikToc and turned into a full fleged business out of nothing. All of her soaps and candles are melted and scented in house using only the finest and most intriguing ingredients. I have included her website below. Her store is currently unlisted as she prepares for the upcoming holiday season.</p>

            <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
            <p>Between Mishelle's day job, going to night classes and side business, Mishelle continues to creative write as a side hobby. Starting back in junior high school, this is one of mishelles hobbies that has stuck along all these years. With one of the goals being to eventually have enough content in her writing to eventually become its own book! Mishelle mainly focuses on fantasy and romance content for her writing.</p>
